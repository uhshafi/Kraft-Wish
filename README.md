To use Kraft Wish, here are the steps you need to know which is explained very easily!

#1 Go to the website : (https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification?rapt=AEjHL4Mxhnnz_trs1nxfvW8ILuTdnGd9iWO9rB_WXC7cnqQp8mN92rkHc_NcSmsFa7DJyQoLV9XgrELWc3JXwjxIPzej8xCgIm7QwZ2PR4XtURsU1BwVS9A)
and set up 2 Step Verification if you haven't already, if you have, skip this step.

#2 Once you have set up 2 Step Verification, now go this website : (https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=myaccountsecurity&utm_campaign=tsv-settings&rapt=AEjHL4Mxhnnz_trs1nxfvW8ILuTdnGd9iWO9rB_WXC7cnqQp8mN92rkHc_NcSmsFa7DJyQoLV9XgrELWc3JXwjxIPzej8xCgIm7QwZ2PR4XtURsU1BwVS9A)
and set the "App name" to anything you'd like, preferably, "KraftWish" and it will generate a code. Save that code somewhere to use later.

#3 Now go back to the main page of my KraftWish GitHub repository or if you're lazy, here is the link : (https://github.com/uhshafi/Kraft-Wish)
and download the files "Design.png" "KraftWish.exe" and "logo.png" and save them to a folder preferably named KraftWish.

#4 Open "KraftWish.exe" and enter your email and for the password section, put the code that you generated from the 2 Step Verification earlier. This way
you can trust the app since you are not giving up your real email password. Then enter your friend's or anyone's email and select the date on
when you want to send the email. Then, write your lovely message, it could be a birthday wish, or just something completely random.
After all that, just press the big blue "Send" button and wait 10-20 seconds for it to process the message and send it. Then, you're done! You can close
the app and go on about your day! Have fun and I hope these instructions were simple for you, if not, then leave your question down below!
